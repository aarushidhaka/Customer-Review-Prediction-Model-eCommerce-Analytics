# üõí Customer Review Prediction Model ‚Äì eCommerce Analytics

This project develops a predictive analytics system for **Nile**, a leading South American eCommerce platform, to identify customers most likely to leave positive product reviews. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aimed to boost the platform‚Äôs ROI and strengthen brand reputation by increasing the volume and quality of customer feedback.  

The project was built as part of the *Analytics in Practice* module at Warwick Business School.
